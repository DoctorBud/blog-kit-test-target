## Welcome to the Smartdown Hub

Hi. My name is Dan Keith and I'm the original author of Smartdown. I created Smartdown as a way for me to write interactive articles about subjects I'm interested in; and as a way for students and teachers to more easily author their own *explorable explanations*.

The [Smartdown](https://smartdown.site) technology has been available and in use for a few years now, but the documentation and examples of its use have been scattered across various websites. This new site at [smartdown.github.io/smartdown.io](https://smartdown.github.io/smartdown.io) is an attempt to provide an informational Hub that provides a place for Smartdown integrators, authors, and contributors to discover and share source code, documentation, and examples. In addition, this site serves as the location for a blog (the [Smartdown Chronicles](/blog/)) for Smartdown-related articles.
